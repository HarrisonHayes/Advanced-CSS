                    Hello World! Welcome to my website! I am seeking to become a full time developer. I graduated from Campbell University with a Bachlors of Science specializing in Information Technology & Security. I first fell in love with programming while taking my first javascript courses while attending college. My first application that I ever built was a coin flip game named "Double or Nothing". I remember the struggle, trying my hardest to get the code to work and failing, over, and over again. It was frustrating, but I wanted more. I was determined to get it to work, and I will never forget the feeling I had when it finally functioned as I had envisioned it. Ever since then, I knew that I wanted to embark on this programming journey. This website will house my progression, please enjoy my portfolio and have a look around! If you would like to contact me, please use the form below!
